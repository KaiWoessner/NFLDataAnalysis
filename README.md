This project is a collection of graphs and charts to analyze performances and trends in the National Football League (NFL). Aside from single displays of data, this repo contains smaller projects: Weekly and Yearly Team Rankings, Matchup Calculator, and Visual Game Breakdown. Despite many graphs being set to the current season (2023), this can be changed to analyze similar trends going back to the year 2000. This project uses data from the Python library `nfl_data_py`.
